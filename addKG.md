To use a KG with CBench, the KG must be hosted on the Virtuoso system. To setup your KG on Virtuoso, please follow [Virtuoso documentation](http://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS). Once your KG is ready, provide CBench with the endpoint URL.

If you would like to use DBpedia or Wikidata, you can use the available endpoints (e.g. https://dbpedia.org/sparql? or https://query.wikidata.org/ respectively). If you would like to use them with a specific version of the KG, it is your responsability to download the KG and host it on Virtuoso.
