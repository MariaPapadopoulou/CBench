First,  we  would  like  to  highlight  that  CBench  is  a  test  suite  that  could  include  all  available benchmarks that are used to evaluate QA systems.  We leave the choice of the benchmark(s) that the user would like to use for evaluation to the user.  That said, it is a common practice in QA papers that older benchmarks are used and not necessarily the most recent.  Part of the reason for this is to easily compare to previous systems.  For example, the recent 2 QA systems: TemplateQA [Zheng et al., 2018]  and  KBQA [Cui et al., 2017]  which  published  in  VLDB  used (QALD-5) and (QALD-5,QALD-3,QALD-1) respectively in their evaluation. So, including older  benchmarks in CBench is a feature we believe the users will benefit from.
